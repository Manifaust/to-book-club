# Chapter 3 - Paradigm Overview

Programming languages can all be categorized into three paradigms: Structured, Object Oriented and Functional

## Structured Programming

* Discovered by Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (same guy as the algorithm!)
* use of unrestrained "jumps" `goto` was harmful for the structure of the program
* replaced these jumps with control structures we all know: `if` `then` `else` `do` `while` 

> Structured programming imposes discipline on the direct transfer of control

## Object Oriented Programming

* Discovered by Ole Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard
* discovered polymorphism can be achieve within a programming language via use of function pointers

> Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control

## Functional Programming

* a result of the work of Alonzo Church via lamda-calculus (the foundation of lisp)
* immutability is the foundation of lambda-calc (values of symbols don't change)

> Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment

## Food for thought

* Each of these paradigms restricts a capability in a programming language, not add
* no new paradigms have been discovered since 1968
* each paradigm has it's specialty which address three big concerns of architecture: function, separation of components and data management
