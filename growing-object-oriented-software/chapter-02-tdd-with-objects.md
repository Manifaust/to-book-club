# Chapter 2 - Test-Driven Development with Objects

## A Web of Objects

* OO Design is more focused on the communication between objects than the internal properties and behaviour of the objects
* objects communicate to each other through *messages*

### Values vs Objects

*Values*: models unchangning quantities or measurements. 
*Objects*: models computational processes and have an identity that can change over time

*Communication patterns*: can be enforced in languages (example: Java uses interfaces, abstract classes to act as a set of rules for which objects can send messages to each other
